	<p>Machine Games was established in 2009 by former founding members of Starbreeze Studios and acquired by ZeniMax Media in 2010. Located in Uppsala, Sweden, MachineGames is a studio comprised of a seasoned group of developers recognized for their work creating story-driven games. Their first title, the critically-acclaimed action-adventure shooter, Wolfenstein: The New Order, is a reimagining of the franchise widely credited for helping establish the first-person shooter genre. Launched in May 2014, the game has garnered numerous Game of the Year and Shooter of the Year awards and nominations from media outlets worldwide.
